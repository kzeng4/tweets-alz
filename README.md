# tweets-alz
- this project aims to predict if a post is related to Alzheimer's and demantia caregivers, and further analyze the features and trend of the post owner.
## classification model
We utilized a pre-trained BERT based as well as a LSTM-CNN classifier to classify if a tweet is related. In order to improve the generalization ability, we further adopt data augmentation strategy inculding 'Textattack'.
